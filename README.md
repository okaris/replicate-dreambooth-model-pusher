# Replicate DreamBooth API Weight Pusher

This [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model allows you to easily push trained model weights using the Replicate DreamBooth API. Simply feed in your input weights in the form of a zip file containing the trained model weights, and let the API do the rest. The trained model will then be pushed by cog and you will recieve your model version.

## Usage

To use the [DreamBooth API](https://replicate.com/blog/dreambooth-api), you will need to provide the following information:

**Input weights:** These are the trained model weights that will be used to train the model. They must be provided in the form of a zip file, containing the model's weights.
Once you have provided the required information, you can call the API using a standard HTTP request. The API will then return a trained model that you can use in your application.
